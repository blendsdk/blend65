/**
 * IL Quality Metrics and Analytics Framework Types
 *
 * Comprehensive type definitions for sophisticated IL quality assessment including:
 * - Complexity metrics (McCabe cyclomatic, instruction complexity, control flow complexity)
 * - Performance prediction models (cycle estimation, memory usage, register pressure)
 * - Optimization readiness scoring (pattern applicability, safety analysis)
 * - Quality gates with definitive pass/fail criteria
