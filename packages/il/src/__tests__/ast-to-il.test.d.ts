/**
 * Tests for AST to IL Transformer
 * Task 2.3: Create AST to IL Transformer - Test Suite
 *
 * This test suite validates the AST to IL transformation for all Blend65 language constructs.
 * Tests cover expression evaluation, statement transformation, control flow, and optimization
 * metadata integration.
 *
 * Educational Focus:
 * - How AST nodes map to IL instruction sequences
 * - Temporary variable management in expression evaluation
 * - Control flow transformation for optimization
 * - Integration testing for semantic analysis metadata
