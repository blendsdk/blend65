### A.I Agent instructions / Cline instructions

## IMPORTANT:

These rules are mandetory and must be applied strictly.

1. In Plan mode allways, ask yourself (the A.I) these questions before answering: "Do you understand?", "Any questions?"
2. In plan mode review, rewrite and enhance the prompt and ask me questions if something is not clear to get better results.
